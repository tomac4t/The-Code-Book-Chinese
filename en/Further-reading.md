## FURTHER READING

Here are some books you can read if you would like to explore the subject of cryptography in more depth. There is also a great deal of interesting material on the Internet relating to codes and ciphers. In addition to the books, I have therefore listed a few of the Web sites that are worth visiting.

### General
- Kahn, David, *The Codebreakers* (New York: Scribner, 1996). <br>
  A 1,200-page history of ciphers. The definitive story of cryptography up until the 1950s.
- Smith, Lawrence D., *Cryptography* (New York: Dover, 1943). <br>
  An excellent elementary introduction to cryptography, with more than 150 problems. Dover publishes many books on the subject of codes and ciphers.
- *The Code Book on CD-ROM*. A fully interactive version of *The
Code Book* is now available. It contains encrypting and codebreaking tools, a virtual Enigma machine and video clips. More details on its contents and how to obtain it are available at [www.simonsingh.com](http://www.simonsingh.com).

### Chapter 1
- Gaines, Helen Fouché, *Cryptanalysis* (New York: Dover, 1956). <br>
  A study of ciphers and their solution. An excellent introduction to cryptanalysis, with many useful frequency tables in the appendix.
